// The ability to specify a command line option (­s x) to change the size of the buffer used for calls to
// read and write to be x bytes.


// • The ability to specify a command line option (­n x) to change the number of bytes read from each file
// to x. (Instead of reading the whole file as we would have without this option.)


// • The ability to specify a command line option (­c x) to have the program apply a Caesar cipher with a
// shift of x to alphabetical characters in the data read before writing its results.
void caesarCipher(char &buffer[], int shift)
{
    //isalpha(char) returns 0 if char is a alphabetic letter.

}

// • The ability to specify a command line option (­r x) to have the program apply a rotation of x to each
// byte read from the file before sending the data to be output.


// • The ability to specify a command line option (­x) to output the data in the file as hexadecimal.


// • The ability to specify a command line option (­b) to output in binary notation, most significant bit
// first.
